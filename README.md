# hello-world
Made by a guy who ain't got a clue what he is doing.
Edmond here, I am a Senior at Saint Auguestine's university learning how to code.
I have worked with Java, C++, HTML, and CSS, my favorite tool to code with is Visual Studio because
it has very helpful features such as color coding text and identifing and highlighting errors as I type, perfect for a newbie like me, I do have multiple ideas for video games as I do game a lot.
By the way Hubot, Earth pizza is the only type of pizza worthy enough to be consumed by gods.
